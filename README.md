## Part A
##1) Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Divisions
### Front end
The front-end part of a website, also known as the client-side, refers to the part of the website that the user interacts with directly. 

### Back End
- The back-end part of a website, also known as the server-side, handles the processing, storage, and retrieval of data, as well as the logic and functionality of the website. 

## Working
- When a user interacts with frontend elements, such as submitting a form or clicking a button, the frontend captures the input and sends it to the backend. 
- The backend receives the HTTP request from the frontend. It processes the request, extracting relevant data, and performing any necessary actions based on the request type and data received. This can include tasks like validating data, interacting with databases, executing business logic, or integrating with external services or APIs.
- After processing the request the frontend receives the HTTP response from the backend. It interprets the response, extracting the necessary data and content. The frontend then uses this data to update the user interface, display new information, or trigger specific actions. It renders the received content, applying styles, layout, and interactivity as defined in the frontend code.
- The cycle of user interaction, frontend handling, request sending, backend processing, and response rendering continues as long as the user interacts with the website.
